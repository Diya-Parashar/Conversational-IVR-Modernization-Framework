AI-Enabled IVR Modernization for IRCTC
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on modernizing legacy IRCTC Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems built using VoiceXML (VXML) by integrating them with modern Conversational AI platforms such as Azure Communication Services (ACS) and BAP Service.

The solution reuses and extends existing VXML-based IVR assets to enable AI-driven conversational interactions, minimizing rework while significantly improving user experience, scalability, and usability.
